This project is an Anki addon for English pronunciation assessment. You can record your own voice when studying a flashcard and get an overview of what your pronunciation looks like!

## How it works

When you are reviewing a flashcard and press `Ctrl + W` AnkiPA_Local starts to record your voice and will then analyse the recording to grade your pronunciation. Scores over 60 are considered accurate.

For Mac the command will be `Cmd + W`.

## Installation

Open Anki and go to **Tools** -> **Add-ons** -> **View Files**.

Clone or download this repository, and place the entire uncompressed raw folder in the Anki addons directory previously opened. 


## Results

After clicking on `Save` button, in few seconds a popup screen will appear showing details about your pronunciation. It shows the percentage scores for accuracy, fluency and overall pronunciation , the amount of errors you committed and what words your pronounced correctly. The result screen looks like this:
